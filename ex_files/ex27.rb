# make a table and memorize boolean logic everyday and commit it to memory
=begin 
today is 22-July-2016, and i'm handwriting this in my notebook 
instead of typing it in to this file.
I will keep tracking by updating this file every instance that I write down
the tables in my notebook, and I will commit it to memory and recite it aloud
twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening before retiring to bed.
